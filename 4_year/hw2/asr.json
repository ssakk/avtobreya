	"whisper": " Hello Peachies! Welcome back to Dear Peachy, in our video today. We are going to show you a quick tutorial for this Stoye and Dolly Soft Glam look. This beauty guru here named C.O.Tar, and she has gained more than 200,000 followers on her C.O.Hungshu. If you love to try Dolly makeup, but do not know how to start, this look is perfect for you to begin. First, Tala is going to prep her skin before applying her base. She is moisturizing the dry patches on her face using the Serum bomb stick. She is applying at the sides of nose, mouth corners, and under eye to avoid her base from creasing later. If you have the same issue, you can apply any lightweight moisturizer that you have on those dry patches. Let the moisturizer set for around 15 minutes before you apply any makeup, so that the moisturiser gets absorbed by the skin. Once the skin here is set into your skin, layer a thin coat of foundation to even out your skin tone. Pat them out with a cushion sponge. Matt Highlighter is dabbed at the inner cheeks to brighten the center region of her face. You can also use a lighter shade of concealer to do so. Then, put on some setting powder to achieve that natural look. For brows, Tala is filling them in with brow powder. She mentions that she prefers the light and fuzzy looking brows today. Nothing too annular. Just follow your natural brow shape we'll do. She conjures her nose from the nose roots towards the nose bridge. And she fills in a V shape at her nose tip with a light hand. Add a little bit of contour at the lower lip and fill them to deepen their shadow. It can make your lips look more powdery. If you're going for a cute look, you do not need to apply contour to your jaws. The chisel gel might actually make your makeup look sexier. Instead of making it appear more dolly. Contour to bring your cheekbones inwards, so your face shape will look less annular to match with this look. And add a little bit below your chin to make your face look shorter and younger. For eyes and blush, Tala is going to use a warm pink shade blusher from a China brand. Girl called in the shade Fua. She said just a light touch all over your lid is enough. I'm facized more on the lower lid and egg yellow cell. For blush, apply the same blush at the same region where you apply them at highlighter. Apply some at the nose tip and chin. Eyelashes is a must to enhance your eye shape. Besides curling them. Tala is putting on the individual falsies to accentuate her actual lashes. Fill in the blank spots at your inner lash line with a liquid liner. Extend a winged liner from your outer corner, with an egg yellow cell liner. Tala is going over to her contour again to deepen the shadow at the center of her pupil. Add more at the lower lash line to make your eyes look rounder. Highlight the center of your egg yellow cell and inner corner. Apply a light pink lip shine for that glossy lip look. Lastly, she adapts the shimmery highlighter at the tip of her nose and nose bridge. An inner corner and the look is done. A very refreshing, cute and dolly makeup look that is perfect for any occasion. We just love how girly and adorable she looks here. What do you guys think? Comment down below to let us know. Thank you so much for watching. We will see you in the next video. Goodbye.",
